## Explanation of overall points and penalties

- Overall - up to 10 pts
  - 3 pts - Answered all 4 questions
  - 4 pts - Organization: Reasonably sized figures, no crazy large text, questions answered in order, easy to follow
  - 3 pts - Code style (spaces around operators, spaces after commas, line breaks after %>% and +, etc.)
  
- Potential penalties - up to 8 pts deduction
  - 5 pts - Requires reproduction (If figures don't show up in the .md file on GitHub and/or if that file is not committed and pushed at all, and you end up needing to clone/download and reproduce the work to be able to mark it.)
  - 3 pts - Unaddressed warnings (There are warnings, and they have not been correctly addressed in the narrative.)
